Naumachia Challenges
====================

Welcome to the open-source repository for `Naumachia <https://github.com/nategraf/Naumachia>`_ challenges! If you have some challenge ideas and/or code to contribute, I would love to see it!

All of the challenges in this repository can be played live at `naumachiactf.com <https://naumachiactf.com>`_, and you can join the `Discord <https://discordapp.com/invite/gH9ZgeT>`_ channel to chat!

The challenges in this repository are challenges I have written for past CTFs and open-sourced after. It's my hope that this is helpful to developers who are interested in writing their own challenges or just curious as to how it all works.

Note:
  Many of these challenges use a network IPAM driver called "mini". That refers to my `mini-ipam driver <https://github.com/nategraf/mini-ipam-driver>`_ which is designed to allocate small subnets (as opposed to the default which allocates /20 and /24 subnets and runs out quickly).
  You may either remove the driver line for testing and small deployments, or download and run the mini-ipam driver on your host
