# The file defines the configuration for simple Nauachia challenge
# where a sucessful man-in-the-middle (MTIM) attack 
# (such as ARP poisoning) provides a solution

# If you are unfamiliar with docker-compose this might be helpful:
# * https://docs.docker.com/compose/
# * https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/
#
# But the gist is that the services block below specifies two containers,
# which act as parties in a vulnerable communication

services:
    bob:
        build: ./bob
        image: naumachia/example.bob
        environment:
            - CTF_FLAG=fOOBaR

    alice:
        build: ./alice
        image: naumachia/example/alice
        depends_on:
            - bob
        environment:
            - CTF_FLAG=fOOBaR

# To avoid users from using this challenge as a personal VPN
# gateway to the internet, it is important to specify the
# default network as internal (i.e. not connected to the internet)

networks:
    default:
        internal: true
        ipam:
            driver: mini
