# Public Naumachia Challenges

This is a repo of Naumachia challenges from past CTFs which have been open-sourced

Note: Many of these challenges use a network IPAM driver called "mini". That refers to https://github.com/nategraf/mini-ipam-driver which is designed to allocate small subnet (as opposed to the default which allocates /20 and /24 subnets and runs out quickly). You may either remove the driver line for testing and small deployments, or download and run the mini-ipam driver on your host
